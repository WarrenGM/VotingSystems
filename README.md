This projects provides implementation for various ranked ballot voting algorithms. At this moment it includes  first past the post (plurality voting), instant runoff voting (AKA the alternative vote and ranked choice voting), the Borda count, and the Condorcet Method. More systems will be implemented in the future.
The code includes a poll.java class which runs a sample the voting program in the console. It's main purpose is to demonstrate how to add multiple ballots in a single line.
